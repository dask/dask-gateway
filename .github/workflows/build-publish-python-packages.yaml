  # Builds sdist (.tar.gz) and wheels (.whl) for the Python packages.
  #
  # - dask-gateway's wheel is platform and CPU architecture independent
  # - dask-gateway-server's wheel is platform dependent (linux/mac) and CPU
  #   architecture dependent (amd64/arm64) because of the compiled Golang
  #   binary.
  #
  # Golang cross platform (GOOS env) and cross architecture (GOARCH env)
  # compilation is used to produce different artifacts independent of the job's
  # platform and CPU architecture.
