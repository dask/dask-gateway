          # - The Python version installed where dask-gateway and
          #   dask-gateway-proxy is run by the end user matters, so we test
          #   against all the versions we intend to support.

          #   We could for example choose to test against the versions that
          #   hasn't reached end of life yet: https://endoflife.date/python.

          #   dask-gateway-server/dask-gateway-proxy bundled for the
          #   dask-gateway-server Python package is the only thing that matters.
