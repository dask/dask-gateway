# This is the configuration for chartpress, a CLI for Helm chart management.
#
# chartpress can be used to:
# - Build images
# - Update Chart.yaml (version) and values.yaml (image tags)
# - Package and publish Helm charts to a GitHub based Helm chart repository
#
# Currently, this project is configured to use the skaffold CLI to build images
# and update the image tags in values.yaml, but chartpress is still used to
# publish the Helm chart to the gh-pages branch of dask/helm-chart.
#
# For more information about chartpress, see the projects README.md file:
# https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress
