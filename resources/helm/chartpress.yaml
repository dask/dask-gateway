# This is configuration for chartpress, a CLI for Helm chart management.
#
# chartpress is used to test, package, and publish the dask-gateway Helm chart
# to the gh-pages based Helm chart repository at https://helm.dask.org and
# https://github.com/dask/helm-chart respectively. Note that a Helm chart
# repository is just a website that can serve a "index.yaml" file pointing to
# packaged Helm charts that can be downloaded.
#
# chartpress is used to:
# - Build images for multiple CPU architectures
# - Update Chart.yaml (version) and values.yaml (image tags)
# - Package and publish Helm charts to a GitHub based Helm chart repository
#
