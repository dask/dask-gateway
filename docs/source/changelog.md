## 2022.4.0

This release is the first in a long time, and with it comes significant
improvements in documentation and automation to make it easier to cut releases
going onwards.

The project now adopts [CalVer](https://calver.org/) versioning with a
`YYYY.MM.MICRO` format similar to other Dask organization projects using the
slightly different `YYYY.0M.MICRO` format with a leading zero on the month.

### Breaking changes

- `dask-gateway` and `dask-gateway-server` now requires Python 3.8+
- Breaking changes to the `dask-gateway` Helm chart:
  - _ACTION REQUIRED_: When upgrading to this version you must also update the Helm chart's bundled CRD resources like this:
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dask/dask-gateway/2022.4.0/resources/helm/dask-gateway/crds/daskclusters.yaml
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dask/dask-gateway/2022.4.0/resources/helm/dask-gateway/crds/traefik.yaml
    ```
  - Now published to the Helm chart repository https://helm.dask.org.
  - Now require k8s 1.20+ and `helm` 3.5+.
  - Now bundles with a [`values.schema.json`
    file](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#schema-files) that won't tolerate
    most unrecognized configuration to help users avoid typos in their configs.
  - Now pushes the Helm chart's images to `ghcr.io/dask/dask-gateway-server` and
  `ghcr.io/dask/dask-gateway`.
  - Now declares the purpose of `ghcr.io/dask/dask-gateway` to be a truly
    minimal image for Helm chart testing purposes and encourages users to
    maintain their own image for worker and scheduler pods. See [the related
    documentation](https://gateway.dask.org/install-kube.html#using-a-custom-image)
    on using your own image.
