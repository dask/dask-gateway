Dask Gateway
============

Dask Gateway provides a secure, multi-tenant server for managing Dask_
clusters.  It allows users to launch and use Dask clusters in a shared,
centrally managed cluster environment, without requiring users have direct
access to the underlying cluster backend (e.g. Kubernetes, YARN, Job queues,
etc...).

Architecture Overview
---------------------

Dask Gateway is divided into four separate components:

- Multiple active **Dask Clusters** (potentially more than one per user)
- A **Web proxy** for proxying the Dask Web UI for each cluster
- A **Scheduler proxy** for proxying the connection between the user's client
  and their respective scheduler
- A central **Gateway** that manages authentication and cluster startup/shutdown

The gateway is designed to be flexible and pluggable, and makes heavy use of
traitlets_ (the same technology used by the Jupyter_ ecosystem). In particular,
both the cluster backend and the authentication protocol are pluggable.

**Cluster Backends**

- `Hadoop/YARN`_
- Local Processes
- Job Queue Systems (PBS_, Slurm_, ...)
- Kubernetes_

**Authentication Methods**

- `Kerberos <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)>`__
- `JupyterHub service plugin <https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__
- Basic (for testing only)
