Usage
=====

Here we walk through a typical user workflow. This assumes you've already
installed the ``dask-gateway`` client library (see :doc:`install-user`) and
have a ``dask-gateway-server`` running somewhere. For a completely local setup
of both client and server (for demos, testing, etc...) see :doc:`install-local`
instead.

.. currentmodule:: dask_gateway

Connect to a dask-gateway server
--------------------------------

Users interact with a ``dask-gateway-server`` via the ``dask-gateway`` client
library. Typically a session starts by creating a :class:`Gateway` client. This
takes a few parameters:

- ``address``: The full address of the dask-gateway server.
- ``proxy_address``: The full address of the dask-gateway scheduler proxy. If
  not provided, this defaults to port 8786 on the same host as ``address``
  above.
- ``auth``: The authentication method to use

The values for each of these are specific to your deployment - consult your
administrator for more information about your specific deployment.

.. code-block:: python

    from dask_gateway import Gateway

    # -- Here we provide a few examples of creating a `Gateway` object --

    # Gateway server running at http://mygateway.com, scheduler proxy at
    # tls://mygateway.com:8786, with kerberos authentication
    gateway = Gateway(
        address="http://mygateway.com",
        auth="kerberos"
    )

    # Gateway server at http://146.148.58.187, scheduler proxy server at
    # tls://35.202.68.87:8786, with JupyterHub authentication
    gateway = Gateway(
         "http://146.148.58.187",
         proxy_address="tls://35.202.68.87:8786",
         auth="jupyterhub",
    )

Typically these parameters are configured once in :doc:`configuration-user`, at
which point a :class:`Gateway` object can be created with no parameters.

.. code-block:: python

    from dask_gateway import Gateway

    # Use values stored in your local configuration (recommended)
    gateway = Gateway()

To check that everything is setup properly, query the gateway to see any
existing clusters. If this call completes, you should have a properly
configured gateway client.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> gateway.list_clusters()
    []


.. _usage-create-new-cluster:

Create a new cluster
--------------------

To create a new cluster, you can use the :meth:`Gateway.new_cluster` method.
This will create a new cluster with no workers.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> cluster = gateway.new_cluster()
    >>> cluster
    GatewayCluster<6c14f41343ea462599f126818a14ebd2>

Alternatively, you can skip creating a :class:`Gateway` object, and use the
:class:`GatewayCluster` constructor directly.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from dask_gateway import GatewayCluster
    # Create a new cluster using the GatewayCluster constructor directly
    >>> cluster = GatewayCluster()

The choice between methods is largely preferential. If you need to interact
with the gateway server only to create a new cluster then using
:class:`GatewayCluster` may be simpler. If you need to perform other operations
(e.g. querying running clusters) then you may wish to use a :class:`Gateway`
instead.


Configure a cluster
-------------------

Some ``dask-gateway-server`` deployments allow users to configure their
clusters upon launching. Typical options may include specifying worker
memory/cores or which docker image to use. To see which options (if any) your
server supports you can use the :meth:`Gateway.cluster_options` method.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> options = gateway.cluster_options()
    >>> options
    Options<worker_cores=1, worker_memory=1.0, environment='basic'>

This returns a :class:`Options` object, which describes the options available.
The options object is a MutableMapping_, that also supports attribute access of
fields.

.. code-block:: python

    # Both attribute and key access works
    >>> options.worker_cores
    1
    >>> options["worker_cores"]
    1

    # Can change values using attribute or key access
    >>> options.worker_cores = 2
    >>> options.worker_cores
    2

Note that validation of the fields is done both client and server-side. For
example, if a limit has been set on a numeric field (e.g. max
``worker_cores``), then a nice error will be raised if that limit is exceeded.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> options.worker_cores = 10
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		...
	ValueError: worker_cores must be <= 4, got 10

If you're working interactively in a `Jupyter Notebook`_ or JupyterLab_ and
have ipywidgets_ installed, you can also use the provided widget for
configuring your cluster.

.. image:: /_images/options-widget.png
    :alt: Cluster options widget

Once :class:`Options` object has the desired values set, you can pass this to
:meth:`Gateway.new_cluster` or :class:`GatewayCluster` to use these values when
creating a new cluster.

.. code-block:: python

    # Using Gateway.new_cluster
    >>> cluster = gateway.new_cluster(options)

    # Or using the GatewayCluster constructor
    >>> cluster = GatewayCluster(cluster_options=options)

Alternatively, if you know the configurable options available on your
``dask-gateway-server`` deployment, you can pass in your values directly as
keyword arguments to either method:

.. code-block:: python

    # Using Gateway.new_cluster
    >>> cluster = gateway.new_cluster(worker_cores=2, environment="tensorflow")

    # Or using the GatewayCluster constructor
    >>> cluster = GatewayCluster(worker_cores=2, environment="tensorflow")


Scale up a cluster
------------------

To scale a cluster to one or more workers, you can use the
:meth:`GatewayCluster.scale` method. Here we scale our cluster up to two
workers.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> cluster.scale(2)

If you're working interactively in a `Jupyter Notebook`_ or JupyterLab_ and
have ipywidgets_ installed, you can also use the provided widget to change the
cluster size, instead of calling :meth:`GatewayCluster.scale` programmatically.

.. image:: /_images/scale-widget.png
    :alt: Manual scaling widget


Enable adaptive scaling
-----------------------

Alternatively, you can use `adaptive scaling`_ to allow your cluster to scale
up/down based on load. This can be useful in reducing resource usage only to
what's currently required for your workload. To enable adaptive scaling you can
use the :meth:`GatewayCluster.adapt` method.

.. code-block:: python

    # Adaptively scale between 2 and 10 workers
    >>> cluster.adapt(minimum=2, maximum=10)

As with manual scaling above, if you're working in a notebook environment you
can also use the provided widget to enable adaptive scaling , instead of
calling :meth:`GatewayCluster.adapt` programmatically.

.. image:: /_images/adapt-widget.png
    :alt: Manual scaling widget

If you wish to disable adaptive scaling later you can pass in ``active=False``:

.. code-block:: python

    # Disable adaptive scaling
    >>> cluster.adapt(active=False)


Connect to the cluster
----------------------

To connect to the cluster so you can start doing work, you can use the
:meth:`GatewayCluster.get_client` method. This returns a
``dask.distributed.Client`` object.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> client = cluster.get_client()
    >>> client
    <Client: scheduler='tls://198.51.100.1:65252' processes=2 cores=2>


Run computations on the cluster
-------------------------------

At this point you should be able to use normal ``dask`` methods to do work. For
example, here we take the mean of a random array.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import dask.array as da
    >>> a = da.random.normal(size=(1000, 1000), chunks=(500, 500))
    >>> a.mean().compute()
    0.0022336223893512945


Shutdown the cluster
--------------------

When you're done using it, you can shutdown the cluster using the
:meth:`Cluster.shutdown` method. This will cleanly close all dask workers, as
well as the scheduler.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> cluster.shutdown()

Note that when a :class:`GatewayCluster` object is used as a context manager,
``shutdown`` will be called automatically on context exit:

.. code-block:: python

    with gateway.new_cluster() as cluster:
        client = cluster.get_client()
        # ...

Alternatively, lingering cluster objects will be automatically shutdown when
your client process closes. It's good practice to explicitly clean things up,
but it's not strictly necessary. If you want clusters to persist longer than
the lifetime of your client process, set ``shutdown_on_close=False`` when
calling :meth:`Gateway.new_cluster`.


Connect to an existing cluster
------------------------------

Alternatively, you can leave a cluster running and reconnect to it later.  To
do this, set ``shutdown_on_close=False`` when calling
:meth:`Gateway.new_cluster` - this allows Dask clusters to persist longer than
the lifetime of your client process.

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a new cluster which will persist longer than the lifetime of the
    # client process
    cluster = gateway.new_cluster(shutdown_on_close=False)

To connect to a running cluster, you need the cluster's name (a unique
identifier). If you don't already know it, you can see all running clusters
using the :meth:`Gateway.list_clusters` method.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> clusters = gateway.list_clusters()
    >>> clusters
    [ClusterReport<name=ce498e95403741118a8f418ee242e646, status=RUNNING>]

You can then connect to an existing cluster using the :meth:`Gateway.connect`
method.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> cluster = gateway.connect(clusters[0].name)
    >>> cluster
    GatewayCluster<ce498e95403741118a8f418ee242e646>
