# This file describes the requirements to build the documentation, which you can
# do by the following commands:
#
#   pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
#
#   cd docs
#   make html
#
dask-sphinx-theme
myst-parser
sphinx

# sphinx-autobuild enables the "make devenv" command defined in the Makefile to
# automatically rebuild the documentation on changes and update live-reload a
# browser.
sphinx-autobuild

# sphinx-copybutton provides code segments with a copy button.

# autodoc-traits will inspect the dask-gateway and dask-gateway-server's Python
# code to generate reference documentation. It will omit files if ImportErrors
# are thrown so we install these packages with all dependencies to avoid that.
#
# Note that we don't have to install pykerberos for autodoc-traits inspection of
# dask-gateway. This is because .py files can be loaded without errors as
# "import kerberos" statements only show up within functions.
