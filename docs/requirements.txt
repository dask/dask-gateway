dask-sphinx-theme>=3.0.5
myst-parser

# FIXME: This workaround is required until we have sphinx>=5, as enabled by
#        dask-sphinx-theme no longer pinning sphinx-book-theme==0.2.0. This is
#        tracked in https://github.com/dask/dask-sphinx-theme/issues/68.

# sphinx-autobuild enables the "make devenv" command defined in the Makefile to
# automatically rebuild the documentation on changes and update live-reload a
# browser.
sphinx-autobuild

# autodoc-traits will inspect the dask-gateway and dask-gateway-server's Python
# code to generate reference documentation. It will omit files if ImportErrors
# are thrown so we install these packages with all dependencies to avoid that.
#
# Note that we don't have to install pykerberos for autodoc-traits inspection of
# dask-gateway. This is because .py files can be loaded without errors as
# "import kerberos" statements only show up within functions.
