#
#   pre-commit.ci is a service that is enabled for this repo via
#   https://github.com/organizations/dask/settings/installations to do the
#   following:
#
#   1. Automatically keep the pinned versions in this file updated by opening PRs.
#   2. Automatically run a pre-commit test like a GitHub workflow also could do.
#   3. Automatically add a commit with autoformatting changes to PRs if they have
#      forgot to run configured autoformatters.
