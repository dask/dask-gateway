# This config ensures that the PATH environment variable this only-for-testing
# container is started with is preserved when changing to other users with sudo.
#
# NOTES:
#
# - `sudo` is used to execute commands as other users. What then happens to the
#   environment will be determined by configuration in /etc/sudoers and
#   /etc/sudoers.d/* as well as flags we pass to the sudo command. The behavior
#   can be inspected with `sudo -V` run as root.

#
# - We disable the `secure_path` which is set by default in /etc/sudoers as it
#   would override the PATH variable.
Defaults !secure_path
#
# - We can use the `-E` or `--preserve-env` flag to pass through most
#   environment variables, but understand that exceptions are caused by the
#   sudoers configuration: `env_delete`, `env_check`, and `secure_path`.
#
# - We reduce the `env_delete` list of default variables to be deleted. It has
#   higher priority than the `--preserve-env` flag and `env_keep` configuration.
Defaults env_delete -= "PATH"
