  public-address: null  # The address to the dask-gateway server, as accessible
                        # from a web browser. This will be used as the root of
                        # all browser-facing links (e.g. the dask dashboard).

  proxy-address: null   # The full address or port to the dask-gateway
                        # scheduler proxy. If a port, the host/ip is taken from
                        # ``address``. If null, defaults to `address`.

  auth:
    type: basic         # The authentication type to use. Options are basic,

                        # environment variables).  Set to `false` to disable
                        # this inference. You may also specify a proxy address
                        # explicitly (e.g.  `http://user:password@host:port`).
