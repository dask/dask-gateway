# PURPOSE:
#
# This Dockerfile and image, ghcr.io/dask/dask-gateway, is used by the
# dask-gateway Helm chart. It acts as the sample image for scheduler and workers
# in Dask Clusters created by end users.
#
# The admin installing the dask-gateway Helm chart or its end users are meant to
# specify an image for the scheduler and worker pods to use that meets their
# needs for the Dask clusters they startup. Please build your own according to
# the documentation if this very limited image doesn't meet your needs.
#
# See https://gateway.dask.org/install-kube.html#using-a-custom-image.
